QUESTION-3:

Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript


ANSWER:

A brief explanation of the difference between window, screen and document objects:,

Window, screen, and document in javascript, are defined in the context of the browser tab the webpage is displayed on.

The fundamental relationship between the three, is their presence in each browser tab with each tab having its own window,
while a window has window.document and window.screen properties associated with the window class.

For each browser tab there is a respective top-level window object. Document objects are used for rendering the window object, 
while screen object defines the physical attributes of the display.
